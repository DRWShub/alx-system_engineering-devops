Test and verify your assumptions

The idea is to ask a set of questions until you find the issue. For example, if you installed a web server and it isn’t serving a page when browsing the IP, here are some questions you can ask yourself to start debugging:

    Is the web server started? - You can check using the service manager, also double check by checking process list.
    On what port should it listen? - Check your web server configuration
    Is it actually listening on this port? - netstat -lpdn - run as root or sudo so that you can see the process for each listening port
    It is listening on the correct server IP? - netstat is also your friend here
    Is there a firewall enabled?
    Have you looked at logs? - usually in /var/log and tail -f is your friend
    Can I connect to the HTTP port from the location I am browsing from? - curl is your friend

There is a good chance that at this point you will already have found part of the issue.
