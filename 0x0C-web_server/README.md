*    What is the main role of a web server: 
        The web  server plays an important role in storing, processing, and delivering web content to users over the internet. A web server is a computer or software 		    that stores website files (such as HTML tags, XML, images, CSS, JavaScript files etc) and responds to requests from user agents (web browsers). When a user           or browser requests a web page, the web server processes the request, retrieves the relevant files, and sends them back to the user's device. 
        Web servers handle various tasks, such as sending and receiving emails, managing file transfers, and hosting webpages. They play a crucial role in the                functioning of the World Wide Web by facilitating the communication between users' devices and the content they wish to access.
*    What is a child process: 
        A child process in computing refers to a process that is created by a parent process. This concept aids operating systems multitasking  and is often referred         to as a subprocess or subtask. Child processes are created to perform specific tasks within the context of the parent process. They inherit certain                   attributes from the parent process, such as file handles, environment variables, and memory space. Child processes can be created using system calls like             fork in Unix-like systems.
